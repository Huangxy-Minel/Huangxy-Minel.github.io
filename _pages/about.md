I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/), advised by [Prof. Kai Chen](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/). Prior to that, I received my M.Phil. in Computer Science from [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/) and my B.Eng. in Network Engineering from [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2023 and 2021, respectively.

#### Research Interests

- Host Network Architecture
- RDMA NICs and SmartNICs
- Operating Systems
- Datacenter Networking

I am currently developing [Axio](https://github.com/axio-project), an open-source framework for accelerated network I/O systems. Axio aims to deliver high-performance, programmable, and extensible network services for datacenter applications. I am always open to discussion and collaboration on topics related to datacenter systems, networking, and system software.
